The College Placement Portal is a web application designed to streamline the process of student placement by enabling admins to manage student data, including uploading large sets of student information for placement activities. This system is built with a MySQL backend to store student data and includes an admin panel for handling bulk data uploads.
The portal aims to simplify data handling for placement coordinators, allowing them to upload student details directly from Excel files. However, there is a current challenge in ensuring that data meets certain quality standards before it’s uploaded to the database.

Bulk Upload of Student Data: Admins can upload thousands of student records from Excel files to the MySQL database.
Data Validation: The system should validate the Excel data to ensure all required fields are present before uploading.
Error Reporting: If required fields are missing, the system should notify the admin and prevent the upload.

***********CURRENT ISSUE**************

 When an admin uploads an Excel file with student data, the application should verify that all required fields are filled (e.g., Name, University Roll Number, Phone Number, Email Address). However, there is no current mechanism to validate this data before it’s uploaded to the database. This leads to potential issues with incomplete or incorrect data in the system.

********HELP**********

 Implement a validation layer that:
1. Checks for missing data in critical fields (Name, University Roll Number, Phone Number, Email Address).
2. Prevents the upload if any required data is missing.
3. Notifies the admin of any errors or missing fields in the uploaded Excel file.
